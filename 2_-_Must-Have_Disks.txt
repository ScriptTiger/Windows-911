Must-Have Disks:
================
If you have Windows, you should have a disk burned from every single one of the below links that is appropriate for your system!!!

UBCD
----
UBCD is good for any OS and is a collection of all those floppies people thought they wouldn't need anymore but can still save your butt in a bind, plus a whole lot more. It also currently comes with a freeware version of Parted Magic for all your partitioning needs, but they are working to replace it with their own UBCD distro in the future. With everything from virus scanners to password crackers to data recovery and memory diagnostics, this is definitely a must-have!

TechBench
---------
The TechBench website may seem unassuming and maybe even shady, but it's actually home to a download link generator which generates links to various flavors of Windows that are downloaded directly from software-download.microsoft.com (See for yourself when you are given a download link!), so you don't need to worry about them being hacked and cracked versions that you might find floating around in torrents. With modern versions of Windows, always keeping an up-to-date version of your OS's install disk allows you the option to be able to reinstall your current OS without losing any licensing or even any data!
So the next time you decide trying your hand at gambling with Windows updates that land you sitting in front of a "Desktop Location is not available" error with no recovery options, no taskbar, no explorer, and no clue what to do, just CTRL+ALT+DELETE into the Task Manager, More details to make the File menu appear, File, Run new task, Browse. Keyboard shortcuts and right-click options apply here just like they do in the explorer and you can use it to back up what you need to before executing the disk's setup.exe to reinstall. It should also be noted when stuck in a situation like this, you may have to run everything with administrative privileges. Also, by default the Task Manager browser only views "program" file types, so don't forget to change that to "All files" in the bottom right drop-down. Backing your important data up should always be a precautionary step, but if your install disk is newer than your current OS build it will most likely be able to reinstall without losing anything similar to an upgrade. Slightly older install disks may also work, but the older they are the more likely they are to require data loss.

Lubuntu
-------
If Windows just isn't working and you're on a deadline, you can always save your Windows partition for later by resizing it and squeeze Lubuntu and a swap into new partitions, or just wipe everything and just go with Lubuntu and a swap. Lubuntu will just about run on anything while also supporting modern applications you need to get your work done, such as the LibreOffice suite which allows you to create, modify, and save Microsoft Office files and continue on with your work as if nothing happened. Also, since it's based on Ubuntu, which has been shipping preinstalled on many machines direct from manufacturers, it's a short and easy learning curve for beginners just coming from Windows with no experience in Linux at all. It supports low-RAM machines as well as has a couple of different PAE options for older CPUs that run into PAE errors on install, so please read the docs or google around first if you're having trouble installing it.
