Tools to remove other harmfull software:
========================================
Because of the history about Viruses, Add- & Spyware and Rootkits, some other harmful software besides viruses are nowadays (still) better handled by specialized Removal Tools (Software Vendors). So it's highly recommended, that you run on a infected system at least a Virus Scan and a Anti-Add- & Spyware-Scan!

Spybot – Search & Destroy
-------------------------
Safer-Networking's Spybot - Search & Destroy (S&D) is a spyware and adware removal program. S&D don't search in files (like a Antivirus Program) for signatures, instead it knows from every spyware and adware where they place there files in the system and removes those. S&D also repairs (what a AV Program normally don't do) the Registry and many other system settings that can be affected by spyware and adware. Safer-Networking unfortunately don't have a download link for a finished CD/ISO - instead you have to create your own. Here is the documentation, how it works:

Adaware Rescue USB Key/CD
-------------------------
Adaware (as the name says) is by his history also specialized on Adware. Adaware is a good alternative to Safer-Networking's Spybot - Search & Destroy (S&D). The benefit on this Rescue USB Key/CD is, you don't have to create it by yourself!

SUPERAntiSpyware
----------------
SUPERAntiSpyware from Support.com exist unfortunately also not as a Boot CD. Instead Support.com gives you the chance to download a Portable Version with the newest signatures that you can copy/burn to any medium and run it after that on the infected system.

MBAR Tool
---------
If you think your system is infected by a Rootkit, you maybe want to run Malwarebyte's Anti-Rootkit-Tool (MBAR). Malwarebyte also don't offer a Rescue System! Instead you have to install it on the infected system! https://www.malwarebytes.com/antirootkit/
